The video appeals to the foundations of a music that at the time, there was the need to communicate to rise up, fight, escape from oppression and rescue that freedom that was taken away. It transmits a comparison of space-time that invokes the reality and interconnectivity of the past, present and future.” (Gudiño Cabrera, 2019, p. 12)"
